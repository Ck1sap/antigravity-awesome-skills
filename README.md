🚌 IoT-Enabled Smart Bus Route Monitoring & Revenue Management System

A comprehensive digital transport management system designed to improve the efficiency, transparency, and reliability of public bus services in Sri Lanka. This solution integrates IoT hardware with a cloud-based backend to enable real-time monitoring, automated scheduling, and intelligent revenue management.

🚀 Overview

This system leverages IoT devices and modern web/mobile technologies to:

Track bus locations in real-time
Optimize scheduling using policy-driven logic
Monitor driver behavior and safety
Implement fair, distance-based revenue models
Provide actionable insights for transport authorities and bus owners
🏗️ System Architecture

The platform follows a modular architecture:

On-board Unit (OBU):
ESP32 microcontroller collects real-time data from sensors
Cloud Backend:
Processes, analyzes, and stores incoming data
Frontend Applications:
Web portal for administrators
Mobile app for drivers and bus owners
